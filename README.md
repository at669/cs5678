# TBD: Evaluating Effects of Tactile Thermal Feedback on Presence and Sense of Security in Virtual Reality
## Christine Ku, Amanda Trang

### Abstract

Virtual reality commonly stimulates the visual and auditory senses in order to prompt the user to have ownership over the virtual body as well as exhibit a sense of presence. However, haptic technology offers a wide range of feedback methods that potentially deepen the user’s sense of immersion. In particular, we will explore how virtual reality can affect a user’s sense of invincibility by prompting the user to interact with hot and cold interfaces. The sense of immersion and subsequent reactions will be evaluated.
